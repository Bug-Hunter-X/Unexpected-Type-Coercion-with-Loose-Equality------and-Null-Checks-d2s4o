# Unexpected Type Coercion with Loose Equality (==) and Null Checks in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) and null checks.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, resulting in incorrect behavior when comparing values against `null`.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to handle `null` values as input parameters.  However, the use of `==` instead of strict equality (`===`) introduces a subtle flaw.  While the code appears to check for `null`, it will actually allow other values (like 0 and "") to bypass the intended null check due to automatic type coercion.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function. This version uses strict equality (`===`), preventing type coercion and ensuring that only strict null checks occur. Using strict equality eliminates potential ambiguity and improves code reliability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment.
3. Run the functions with various inputs, including `null`, 0, "", and other values, and compare the results to understand the behavior of loose and strict equality in this context.

## Key Learning

This example highlights the importance of using strict equality (`===`) in JavaScript, especially when dealing with null checks or comparisons where accurate type matching is critical. Using loose equality can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors in your JavaScript code.
